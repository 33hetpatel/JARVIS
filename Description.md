# JARVIS
The project is a voice-activated assistant inspired by Jarvis from the Iron Man movies. It is built using Python and incorporates various libraries and modules for speech recognition, text-to-speech conversion, web browsing, email sending, and retrieving information from Wikipedia.

The assistant, named Jarvis, can perform a range of tasks based on voice commands given by the user. It can search for information on Wikipedia, open popular websites like YouTube, Google, and Stack Overflow, play music from a specific directory, provide the current time, open the Microsoft VS Code editor, and send emails.

The project showcases the integration of voice recognition and natural language processing capabilities to create an interactive and hands-free user experience. It demonstrates the ability to interact with the computer through voice commands, making it convenient for tasks like information retrieval, entertainment, and communication.

By uploading this project in your resume, you can showcase your skills in Python programming, utilizing external libraries, implementing speech recognition, and building practical applications. Additionally, it highlights your ability to work with APIs, handle email functionality, and integrate web browsing capabilities.

Overall, this project demonstrates your proficiency in Python programming and showcases your creativity in developing a voice-activated assistant that emulates the fictional Jarvis assistant from the Iron Man movies.
